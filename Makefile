# One `go test` per platform, because only one can be up at a time: they share
# the management subnet, the bridge address, and port 49 on the host. Within an
# invocation the topology is deployed once and every register test measures
# against it.
#
# 120m, not 30m: these are VM images that take minutes to boot, the harness
# waits up to six for each, and L5 alone holds a session open for 150 seconds.
#
# Override the set with either spelling:
#   PORT49_LAB_PLATFORMS=eos,vsrx make lab
#   make lab LAB_PLATFORMS="eos vsrx"
LAB_PLATFORMS ?= eos vjunos vsrx

# A platform that does not measure stops the loop, and the `if` is how. `set -e`
# alone was not enough, and the reason is not the shell: it fires on a non-zero
# exit, and a platform can fail to measure while `go test` exits 0. Naming a
# platform whose image is absent used to skip every test and report success, so
# a three-platform run walked straight past it; so did a typo in a selector,
# which matched nothing and ran nothing. The harness now treats both as errors
# (see platformSelection in tests/lab/harness_test.go) and the loop says which
# platform stopped it rather than leaving that to `Error 1`.
