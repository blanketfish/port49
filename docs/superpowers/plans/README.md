# Plan roadmap

One plan per design §19 step group, written one at a time (see `CLAUDE.md`). This file is
the standing brief for each plan: what it builds, which spec sections it implements, what
earlier plans hand it, what it must leave for later, and which lab register entries close in
it. When writing plan N, start here, then read the cited sections, then the previous plan.

**Every plan's PR body carries an "Operator-facing notes" section**: a short list of what an
operator will see change — new commands, config keys, reason codes, metrics, device behaviour.
Plan 13 builds the user and admin documentation from these.

Status: **1 merged 2026-09-21** (PR #2); **2 merged 2026-09-22** (PR #4;
fifteen tasks, reviewed per task and whole-branch); **3 merged 2026-09-23** (PR #8, below);
**4 written 2026-09-23** (`2026-09-23-04-policy-engine.md`, twenty tasks, one plan — under the
25-task line, so not split); 5–13 not yet. Plan 4 is the next plan to execute.
**2b merged 2026-09-23** (PR #7; `2026-09-23-02b-context-join.md`, nine tasks, reviewed
per task and whole-branch): a second login by the same principal joins the live context
instead of replacing it, stored privilege is raise-only, and accounting attribution gets a
metric. PR #7's body lists three fail-closed follow-ups (one uniform "login into a revoked
result" check after `JoinContext`) for plan 3 to pick up.
**3 merged 2026-09-23** (PR #8; `2026-09-23-03-vertical-slice.md`, eighteen tasks:
thirteen code, three lab, two docs; reviewed per task and whole-branch; first real
certificate-to-device login measured on vEOS). It closes PR #7's first two follow-ups and carries the third to plan 7; its
"Questions for Ryan" section has three open calls.

---

## Plan 1 — Protocol core (§19 step 1) — `2026-09-06-01-protocol-core.md`

RFC 8907 wire, key trial, admission from a file inventory, per-source limits, in-memory
store, authentication/authorization/accounting handlers, decision log, config, `port49d`
binary, containerlab harness. Closes L1 (SSH transport only), L2, L5, L6, L8, L10.

## Plan 2 — Token model (§19 step 2) — `2026-09-22-02-token-model.md`

**Rewritten 2026-09-22 and executed on `feature/token-model`.** The 2026-09-06 draft assumed the `(nas, port)`
login-context key, which the lab showed breaks every measured vendor; the key is now
`(nas, username)` (spec §13 decision 15). The rewrite is against the real tree on
`feature/lab-l4-fallthrough` and carries every ruling in
`2026-09-20-plan-2-revision-notes.md`, the owner's 2026-09-21 ones included
(`contexts_by_principal` stays unencrypted, and why). **Fix round 1 applied 2026-09-22** after
review: **fifteen TDD tasks, sixteen commits**. The spec §5.8 edit for `system` attribution is
committed before the code that reads it, and now also carries §13 decision 15's record that the
`(nas, rem_addr)` enable index is deferred while `enable_username: enab` is refused at load.

**Builds:** the full token semantics on top of plan 1's store interface and handlers.

- Token format with the **device tag**: `tag ‖ secret`, `tag = base62(HMAC(k, device_id))[:6]`,
  24 random characters; daemon compares its own tag before any store access; `device_mismatch`
  under PAP/ASCII/HTTP, `token_not_found` under CHAP. Design §8 "Device binding".
- **Encryption at rest** for tokens, receipts, login context, and the idempotency record,
  with a key shared by broker and daemon and a two-key rotation window. Design §8.
- **Sliding receipt, not a `reusable` flag** (owner, 2026-09-21: "Bob shouldn't need to
  know"). Each re-presentation of the same `(nas, username, credential_sha256)` extends the
  receipt by `receipt_idle_ttl`, up to an absolute `receipt_max_age` from first redemption;
  a presentation past either is FAIL on the wire and `token_spent` in the log (the §5.7 row
  landed with decision 15's rewrite on 2026-09-22; the plan adds only the Go constant);
  revocation deletes the principal's receipts, so receipts are indexed by principal.
  **Defaults ruled 2026-09-22: 15 min idle, 2 h absolute** (Ansible linear strategy over a
  large fleet is the sizing case, L15). Decision 15's text is already replaced.
- **Device-generated accounting under another user** (Junos root RPC in production, NX-OS
  `admin` with `task_id=vsh.bin.$port`) must not trip `foreign_session`: a per-platform rule
  attributing them `system`, which needed a spec §5.8 sentence. **Ruling R1 (Task 11) reversed
  the "ships empty" plan on measured evidence, and spec §5.8 now carries the packet dump behind
  it**: `juniper_junos` ships **`root`** (`internal/platform/platform.go:213-216`).
  `tests/lab/evidence/L1-juniper_vsrx.pcap`, the committed capture behind
  `tests/lab/results/L1-juniper_vsrx.md`, holds three accounting records under `user=root`,
  `port=non-tty`, carrying their own `session_pid`, with no authentication and no authorization
  exchange for root anywhere in the file — vSRX's own alarm machinery writing accounting for a
  session port49 was never asked to authenticate. Without the row a stock vSRX with nothing
  wrong reports sessions port49 did not authenticate. **Every other platform ships empty**,
  including `juniper_vjunos-router` (the same decode of its capture finds no root records, so
  the behaviour is image-specific) and `cisco_nxos` (the `vsh.bin` observation is
  production-only and still has no note). Plan 5 fills the rest, from notes.
- **Refuse at mint any username canonicalization would change**: `Canonical` folds U+0130 onto
  `i`, so two directory names could share one `(nas, username)` context — and it also strips
  `DOMAIN\` and truncates at `@`, which an ASCII-only guard would let through, minting a token
  under a key no redemption can address. `Canonical` moves to `internal/username` so the minter
  can enforce it without importing the daemon that imports the minter.
- **Enable tokens**: mint pair with `kind`. No measured platform sends `$enab{level}$` (L3
  closed): vEOS and IOS-XE send the operator's own username with `service=enable`, NX-OS 10.x
  has no enable. The lookup is therefore the ordinary `(nas, username)` context; an enable
  START must update `privilege` in place and keep `ctx_id` (plan 1 replaces it, measured);
  candidate set filtered to `kind: enable`; `token_kind_mismatch`;
  `enable: none | auto | token`; `rem_addr` binding on enable. `$enab{level}$` becomes an
  explicit `platforms.<name>.enable_username: enab` option **refused at load** until a
  `tests/lab/results/` note shows a device sending it, which is also what keeps
  `enable: auto` inside §5.6's restriction. No `(nas, rem_addr)` index is built, so no new
  reason code is minted for it. Spec §7, §5.6.
- **Candidate-set cap** (order of eight) refusing the mint, never the redemption. Design §8.
- **Full store record set**: `blob`, `contexts_by_principal`, `contexts_by_sid`,
  `contexts_by_cert`, `active_principals`, idempotency record, failure counters; atomic
  remove-and-write-receipt; the race loser reads the receipt and answers PASS. Design §12.
- **Login context in full**: the §5.1.1 shape (`refreshed_at`, `revoked_at`, `auth_time`,
  `session_expires`, `session_discriminator`, `accounting_state`), the teardown rows that
  still have content — 1, 2, 3, 3a, 6, 7; **row 5 is withdrawn and row 4 has no path without
  the `(nas, rem_addr)` index** — and the checks in the §5.3 pseudocode (username, revoked,
  expired, stale, privilege). Accounting annotation binds the **platform's own** session
  discriminator (`session_pid` on Junos, `task_id` elsewhere — `task_id` restarts at 1 per
  session on Junos, L1), sets `closing`, and flags `foreign`. Spec §5.1.1, §5.3, §5.6, §5.8.
- A **mint function** callable in-process (no broker yet) that plan 3's minimal broker wraps.
- **`context_idle_ttl` is absolute, not idle.** Plan 1 sets it at `PutContext` and never
  extends it; `GetContext` does not touch it. Spec §5.6 says activity SHOULD extend it.
  **Ruled in the rewrite: it becomes a true idle TTL and keeps its name** — a key named
  `context_idle_ttl` that measures absolute age lies in its own name, and `session_expires` is
  already the absolute clock. The extension goes through a new TTL-only store method,
  `TouchContext(ctx, key, ttl)`, which writes the expiry and nothing else: re-`PutContext`ing the
  record read at the top of the request would discard a concurrent revocation permanently, on the
  daemon's highest-frequency path. It runs only when the remaining life is below half the TTL, so
  the common command costs no store write, and nothing is deferred to plan 7 for it.

**Hands to plan 3** (as executed, not as planned — each of these is built and tested with no
caller, so plan 3's broker is a transport over an existing core rather than new mechanism):

- **`session.Manager` is built and wired in `cmd/port49d/main.go:215` and nothing calls it.**
  `Refresh`, `RevokeByPrincipal`, `RevokeBySid` and `RevokeByCert` are complete and tested, so
  `/v1/refresh`, `/v1/logout` and `/v1/tokens/revoke` are HTTP over them.
- **`(*token.Minter).Mint(ctx, token.Request) (token.Result, error)`** — the in-process mint
  `POST /v1/tokens` wraps. `reusable` is gone, the kind is chosen by `WithEnable` plus the
  subject's mechanism, and **idempotency is keyed `(principal, device, key)`**, not on the
  header key alone (Task 12 C1: design §17 sends one key for a device *list*, and unscoped,
  device two is handed device one's token, tagged for the wrong device and refused on every
  attempt).
- **Encryption at rest and its two-key read window**, with the
  `port49_crypt_open_failures_total{record}` counter (`token`, `receipt`, `context`,
  `idempotency`) already emitted.
- **`session.staleness_ceiling` defaults to 0, so the `context_stale` check is dead in the
  shipping binary** until something calls `Refresh` on a schedule (spec §5.1.3). **Plan 3 did not
  wire it** (plan 3, Decided 14): the slice reads its policy once and its store dies with the
  process, so a refresh has nothing to carry. Plan 7 wires the schedule and sets the default in the
  same change — a ceiling with no refresher denies every context the moment it is set.

**Leaves for later:** the broker API and its authorization (plan 7); blobs' compiled content
(plan 4, the engine produces them; plan 2 stores opaque bytes by hash).

**Owed by plan 3 or plan 7 — each is documented in the code and now on the roadmap, because a
package comment is not where the next plan looks:**

- **Revocation does not delete the principal's unredeemed tokens** (`internal/session/session.go:14-21`;
  design §1182 assigns it to the broker). A token minted before a revocation still redeems into
  a fresh context with no `revoked_at` on it, by §5.6 row 1's unconditional overwrite. The
  operator sees a revocation that marked every context and deleted every receipt, then a PERMIT
  on a device they thought they had closed, with no log line joining the two. **This is the
  largest remaining hole in revocation.** Plan 7.
- **`crypt_open_failures_total{record="token"}` must become a key-rotation alarm before the
  first rotation.** `Candidates` drops a token it cannot open with a nil error, so the metric is
  the only witness that a rotation retired a key too early
  (`internal/store/crypt/crypt.go:216-231`). Plan 7 with the rest of the alarms, or plan 6 with
  key rotation reporting, whichever lands first.
- **`foreign` has a metric** since plan 2b (`port49_accounting_attributions_total{attribution}`,
  ruled with no rate limit). Nothing further is owed here.
- **Deferred from Task 13 and Task 9, all three settled and none of them work for plan 2:**
  an `ErrPartial` sentinel and the `Refresh`/`mark` `firstErr` asymmetry — `mark` returns the
  refs it touched *and* the first error, `Refresh` returns a count and an error, and plan 7
  owns the broker's error contract, which is where the shape should be decided once
  (`internal/session/session.go:176-220`). And **no compare-and-set on `PutContext` is
  needed**: the lost-update window that asked for one was on `escalate`, and the final review's
  C1 closed it with the narrow setters instead — `SetPrivilege` and `TouchContext`. Every
  writer of a live context now writes through a setter that names its fields.
**Lab:** none close here; L8 (password length) may need re-checking with the 30-character
tagged token. Plan 2 does move the harness off written secrets — `lab.seed_tokens` loses
`secret:`/`kind:`, the daemon mints the pairs and writes them to a `0600` `lab.seed_token_file`,
and `tests/lab/labcreds` reads that file — so the next lab deploy is the first on minted tokens.

## Plan 3 — Vertical slice (§19 step 3) — `2026-09-23-03-vertical-slice.md`

**Builds:** the first real identity reaching a real device with no shared password.

- A **minimal broker**: x509 client-certificate validation against one trust anchor over a
  **held mTLS connection**, literal-identity subjects, a file-backed policy with roles and
  grants and no scopes beyond `all_devices`, mint via plan 2, `/v1/tokens` and `/v1/config`
  only. Design §7 (certificate path), §17 "Minting", spec §13 decision 17.
- The **agent** `port49 login` and `port49 token` commands over that connection. Design §8
  "Two credentials, two lifetimes".
- **Borrowed ahead in simplest form** (say so in the plan): a hand-written admission snapshot
  and key group (plan 6), one blob written and read (plan 4), one platform's session
  attributes (plan 5).
- **eAPI / NX-API per-request authentication** measured in the lab with reusable tokens.
  Images for this are on hand (plan 1 Task 15 lists them with their vrnetlab kinds): Nexus
  9300v 10.4(2)F for NX-API and the L7 question; Catalyst 9000v 17.12 and C8000v 17.13 for
  IOS-XE, where the `$enab15$` enable path (L3) lives; vEOS for eAPI (image tagged 4.32.2F,
  running 4.31.2F).

**Inherits from the 2026-09-20/22 lab stretch (PR #3):** L3 is closed (no platform sends
`$enab{level}$`; NX-OS 10.x has no enable) and the `$enab15$` enable path is gone. L4 is
measured over SSH on all five images and stays open on `deadtime`, the other transports and
authorization fall-through; L7 is measured per request on eAPI and NX-API and stays open on its
cookie clause. So the lab list above is mostly done. What this plan still
owns: the first end-to-end run with a real credential. The sliding receipt is no longer an
open question — plan 2 shipped it as `receipt_idle_ttl` (15m) and `receipt_max_age` (2h), and
`receipt_ttl` is refused by name at config load — but **the agent's reconnect behaviour is
still part of this plan's design**: an agent minting a fresh token on each reconnect removes
most of the idle-gap problem the client matrix showed (L15), and the bounds are the fallback
rather than the answer. **Lab:** the API-transport half of L1 and the eAPI `/login` flow by
hand.

**Lab, as run:** the slice end to end on vEOS (`tests/lab/results/slice-arista_eos.md`); L7's eAPI
`/login` clause measured on vEOS (`L7-login-arista_eos.md`), and L7 still open on NX-API's
`nxapi_auth` cookie (lab register rule 3), with decision 15 provisional on it; L1's RESTCONF
clause measured on IOS-XE (`L1-restconf-cisco_iosxe.md`), and L1 open on the console.

## Plan 4 — Policy engine (§19 step 4)

Spec §3 (normalization), §4 (grammar, pipeline stages), §5.1–§5.5 (mint resolution, blob
compilation, refresh, credential identity, scopes and `attached_roles`, version comparison),
§5.4 (dominance), §5.7 (decision log in full, replay), §6 (privilege levels, attribute
layering, substitution at session authorization), §11 (the complete example as a test
corpus), §12 (`explain`, policy tests, access review, `grants remove --subject`), §14
"Matching and precedence" and "Decision log" assertions. Replaces plan 1's `author.Lab`
with the real `Authorizer`. Produces the compiled blob plan 2 stores.

**The accounting spool needs a sink that can fail.** Plan 1's at-least-once guarantee ends at
`decision.Emitter.Emit`, which returns nothing: the spool deletes its `.draining` file whether
or not the sink took the records. With stdout as the sink that is academic. Whichever plan
first gives the decision log a real sink — this one owns the log in full, but it travels with
the sink if it lands later — must give the spool a sink interface that returns an error, and
the spool must not advance `drainOffset` past a refusal. Without both, the durability contract
is enforced up to the last hop and not across it.

**Carried from plan 3:**

- **Compare the blob's `Platform` with the device's platform at authorization.** Unreachable
  while the broker and the daemon share one inventory, so the slice does not check it; it
  becomes reachable when they stop sharing one.
- **A `GetBlob` store error answers `store_unavailable`** once the store is remote.

## Plan 5 — Platform adapters (§19 step 5)

Spec §8 in full: built-in adapters, entity classes, user overrides and layering, pinned
platform set, `redact` patterns (accounting redaction was deferred from plan 1 and MUST land
here), `capability`/`bits`/`bit_delivery`, the **Junos projection** under decision 22
(bits first, regexes second, refused shape), differential testing in containerlab,
`port49 platform export`. Spec §9 capability inference. **Lab:** L9, L11 (closed), L12; the
projection generator is not final until L12 closes.

**Inherits from the lab (PR #3), per platform — a wrong or extra reply attribute is fatal,
not ignored:**
- **NX-OS**: send `shell:roles`, never `priv-lvl`. The role wins over `priv-lvl` in both
  directions, the role alone suffices, and `priv-lvl` with no role silently picks a role by a
  per-release mapping (0/1/6 → `vdc-operator`, 15 → `network-admin`). An unknown role name
  silently becomes `network-operator`; two roles are a union; a misnamed attribute is
  rejected outright. Custom roles by name work (L16). `network-operator` cannot run bare
  `show interface` (prompts for sudo; `show interface *` works) and the cancelled sudo writes
  an accounting record under `admin` with `task_id=vsh.bin.$port`. **Nothing port49 sends ends
  a session here**: an attribute this device does not understand is ignored under EITHER flag,
  mandatory included, so a wrong attribute is invisible rather than fatal and the RFC 8907 §8.2
  flag buys an adapter no signal at all. Two more entries in the privilege-to-role table, both
  reached with no role in the reply: no attributes at all gives `vdc-operator`, and an
  out-of-range `priv-lvl=99` gives `network-operator` (L18).
- **vEOS**: send the **bare** `roles=<name>` **and** `priv-lvl=N` together — one role name, no
  quotes. The bare attribute is applied under either flag; `shell:roles*` is ignored and a
  mandatory `shell:roles=` or an optional `cisco-av-pair*` **refuses the session**. A role with
  no `priv-lvl` beside it lands the operator at level 1, where they cannot even read their own
  role — the opposite of the NX-OS rule, so the two platforms need different replies. The value
  is taken literally: quotes are kept as part of the name, and an unknown role is echoed back
  rather than degraded. An OPTIONAL `priv-lvl*N` **is** applied on 4.31.2F. Under
  `aaa authorization commands ... local` the delivered role is real privilege (`network-operator`
  is refused `configure`, `network-admin` is not, an unknown name is refused), so port49's
  per-command answer is the only control **while port49 is in the command path** and the role is
  the control when it is not (L16). **On the §8.2 question vEOS is the conformant one**: an
  OPTIONAL attribute it does not read is ignored and a MANDATORY one ends the session, whatever
  the name — an invented attribute does both — so the flag is a working switch here and
  `cisco-av-pair*` is an exception to that rule rather than the rule. A `priv-lvl` value the
  device cannot use is DROPPED rather than clamped: `priv-lvl=99` lands the operator at level 1,
  the same as sending nothing (L18).
- **IOS-XE**: kills the session on any unrecognised attribute, optional included; `priv-lvl`
  only (L3/L16 notes). L18 extends that to a second foreign spelling, an invented attribute and
  an out-of-range `priv-lvl=99` — seven of ten variants refused, all `% Authorization failed.`
  **And the cost is the device, not the session:** after a run of refused authorizations this
  image stops answering SSH for about a minute, refusing connections at the authentication
  layer **without sending port49 a packet**, so nothing in the decision log says it happened and
  break-glass is refused with everyone else. An adapter for this platform must send exactly what
  the device reads and nothing else; there is no cheap mistake here.
- **Junos**: `platforms.juniper_junos.session_services` (default `[junos-exec]`; production
  fleets use `tacplus-options service-name`, e.g. `junos-exec-fw`; the name never selects
  policy). The emitted reference config MUST include `tacplus-options strict-authorization`:
  without it a port49 denial is advisory (login completes, class from the `remote` template);
  with it the denial refuses SSH and NETCONF while break-glass still gets in with port49 down
  (L17). `authorization-time-interval` (min 15 min) re-authorizes but a denial does not end
  the session: revocation cannot reach a live Junos session. `enhanced-accounting` adds the
  client source `Port` to the login record. Accounting `service` stays `shell` whatever the
  session service is; `session_pid` is the per-session discriminator. **Attributes, measured on
  both images and agreeing cell for cell (L18):** `local-user-name=<template>` **is applied**
  under either flag — the session leaves the `remote` template for the class the reply names —
  and **`user-permissions` does nothing at all**, mandatory, optional, or sent beside
  `local-user-name`. So decision 22's projection has one working attribute and one inert one on
  these releases, and the shape it would send is indistinguishable from `local-user-name` alone;
  L12 still has to close on the rest. A template name the device does not have degrades silently
  to the default `remote` template. Everything Junos does not understand is ignored under either
  flag, so nothing port49 sends can end a Junos session by attribute. No variant produced a
  per-command authorization request, on either image, in any of 26 sessions — decision 21's
  shape, confirmed.
- Device-generated accounting under another user (Junos root RPC in production, NX-OS
  `admin`/`vsh.bin`) is real and must not be treated as a foreign session (plan 2 rule).

**Inherits from plan 1:** a Junos session authorization is **permitted and carries no
attributes**. Plan 1 answered every one of them `service_unsupported` until 2026-09-21,
because `author.Handle` required `service=shell` while L10 measured Junos sending
`service=junos-exec`; it now reads the platform's `session_services` list (spec §5.2, §8),
which defaults to `[junos-exec]` for `juniper_junos` and is settable for a fleet that has run
`set system tacplus-options service-name`. So the envelope is recognised and the decision log
shows `permit context_matched` for Junos. **The attributes are this plan's whole remaining
job there**: the session-only projection — class, `local-user-name`, `user-permissions`, the
`allow-commands` / `deny-commands` regexes — is decision 22, gated on L12, and plan 1 sends
none of it.

**Owed from plan 2b (context join):** a configuration check that **warns when a port49-served
username exists as a device-local account** on the device (spec §5.6, "Local account names MUST
NOT collide"). Such an account's commands arrive under the same username and match the port49
context at its highest granted level; `foreign` attribution is the only detection until this check
exists.

**Owed from plan 4 (owner's ruling 2026-09-24):** spec §12's CI reports — the
effective-permission diff, the shadowed-deny report, the privilege-expansion gate, and the
dead-rule and fallback-exposure intersection checks. Plan 4 builds `explain`, policy tests,
access review and `grants remove` and none of these; they land here because the level and role
data the intersection checks need comes from this plan's adapters.

**Possible later, not planned:** per-window contexts on the platforms that give a window its own
stable identifier — EOS `vty<n>`, bound at session authorization
(`tests/lab/results/L1-arista_eos.md`; again 2026-09-22), and IOS-XE `tty<n>`
(`tests/lab/results/L1-cisco_iosxe.md`). The `(nas, username)` join is the design of record; this
would refine it per platform and needs its own ruling first.

## Plan 6 — Inventory service (§19 step 6)

Spec §10: file inventory in full, NetBox and Nautobot connectors, the versioned bundle,
`bundle/diff`, bounded-change safety, **quarantine** (silence, not FAIL — decision 20),
admission snapshot refresh in the daemon, key rotation reporting (`keys status`,
`keys diagnose`, unvalidated-source report), device records, address-added-as-security-event.
Design §10 "Device inventory".

## Plan 7 — Broker in full (§19 step 7)

Design §7 (OIDC public client with PKCE, certificate-to-directory mapping, directory
integration, trust domain by verifier lists), §10 (server pool, pre-warm, grace, replication
lag), §17 (the whole API surface, idempotency, batch mint, **`api:` rights** default
self-only, `/v1/refresh` with `prompt=login` and the cert-path signed-nonce refresh,
`/v1/logout` back-channel), spec §5.1.3 (scheduled refresh through `active_principals`),
§5.1.4 (revocation by `sid`, `sub`, CRL/OCSP), §5.6 session lifetime (ceiling warning,
grace window, `max_session_age` minimum across roles), the staleness ceiling end to end.

**Carried from plan 3:** a store two processes can reach, before the broker leaves `port49d`
(design §19 step 2); the scheduled refresh and the `staleness_ceiling` default, together; PR #7's
third follow-up — a join racing another principal's replace under one username can lose its sid or
certificate index entry (revocation by principal still reaches it); the certificate-to-directory
mapping replacing the slice's declared `username:`; policy reload. Also owed by plan 3's reviews:

- An **atomic put-if-absent idempotency reservation**. Two concurrent requests under one key
  with different bodies can both pass the pre-check today, and the minter's read, mint and
  `PutIdempotency` are three steps, not one.
- **Per-source limits or admission on the broker listener.** One client reconnecting every 30s
  can keep all of `broker.MaxConns` (256) slots full.
- `(*broker.Broker).Server` **returns an error instead of panicking** once a reload path exists.
- A **counter for broker TLS handshake failures**.
- A **per-principal cap on held broker connections**, beside the per-source one. Any
  certificate the anchor signs can open all 256 slots and hold them for `max_session_age`,
  locking every other operator out of `port49 login`.
- **A revocation must reach the held connection.** The slice has no revocation lever: to cut
  someone off, remove their subject from the policy (or re-issue the CA) and restart
  `port49d`, which logs everyone out. A revocation by principal or by certificate must also
  refuse mints on, or close, that principal's held broker connections; otherwise a token
  minted after the revocation lifts it (decision 15).

## Plan 8 — Workload certificates (§19 step 8)

Design §7 "Machine identity" option 2: enrollment, self-renewal, multi-identity subjects,
`username` declared on machine subjects, cross-domain username collision at mint. Unattended
config backup (Oxidized) as the day-one consumer.

## Plan 9 — Agent in full (§19 step 9)

`port49 ssh` with host-key verification and `port49 devices trust`, the OIDC public client,
the in-session re-auth flow, integration examples (design §17 "Integration examples").

## Plan 10 — Kubernetes path (§19 step 10)

Projected ServiceAccount token validation against the cluster JWKS; identity
`system:serviceaccount:<ns>:<name>`; the `k8s` verifier type. Design §7.

## Plan 11 — RFC 9887 TLS listener (§19 step 11)

Separate listener on 300, mutual TLS replacing the shared key, device records expressing
both. Design §11.

## Plan 12 — Deployment (§19 step 12)

Deployment artifacts, the **reference device AAA configuration per platform** (the thing that
disables fall-through on FAIL, design §12), load validation at the §5 target rate, the
failure-matrix tests of design §12 and §14, observability alarms with a metric behind each
(design §15).

Carried here from plan 1's review:

- **A global connection cap.** Today the only one is `EMFILE`, which is the worst possible
  cap: it fails `Accept` for admitted devices too, and it fails the spool's own `OpenFile`, so
  accounting starts answering ERROR. Plan 1 pulled forward the two cheap parts — the
  `accept_error` counter and log, and a 5s header deadline for a source that is not admitted.
  The cap itself, its sizing, and its alarm are this plan's.
- **Accounting throughput is bounded by one disk's fsync latency.** `Offer` holds one mutex
  across a `stat`, an open, a write, an fsync and a close, per record, for the whole fleet.
  The fix is a group commit — batch concurrent offers into one fsync — and it needs this
  plan's load numbers to size. Do not change it before there are numbers.
- **`key_validations_total{key_ref}` is a device-identity label in one deployment shape.** Key
  groups make `key_ref` a fleet-wide label with a handful of values, which is what the
  cardinality rule assumes. A deployment that pins a key per device (the tier-1 pin) turns it
  into one series per device — both a cardinality problem and, against design §15's "device
  identity never appears in metric labels", a correctness one. Say which it is and bound it
  when the alarms are written.

## Plan 13 — User and admin documentation

**Builds:** a published documentation site — MkDocs Material on GitHub Pages, deployed by a
GitHub Action — written when the repository goes public. Four sections:

- **Concepts:** the token, the receipt and the login context; revocation; trust domains.
- **Operator guide:** install, the broker and the agent, `port49 login`, and troubleshooting
  organized by what the operator sees.
- **Admin guide:** policy, roles and grants, key rotation, revocation, and one device-configuration
  page per platform built from `tests/lab/results/`, including the traps the lab measured.
- **Reference:** config keys, reason codes, metrics and the decision-log schema, generated from the
  code so it cannot drift.

**Inherits:** from every earlier plan, the "Operator-facing notes" section of its PR body (top of
this file).

**Leaves for later:** nothing. **Lab:** none.
